Ragnarok is a 2D engine built on top of Pygame to make game creation easier. While Pygame is a library, Ragnarok attempts to assume the role of an engine, featuring many capabilities that would take a lot of work to create from the ground up in Pygame.

The engine is built in such a way that it attempts to be used under any scenario and game environment (i.e. it is generic). It is easy to set up, maintain, and extend for your particular needs.
 

A few of the features Ragnarok has to offer:

+2D and 3D Math Library
+Sprites for easy rotation, scaling, texture loading, etc.
+SpriteSheet and Animation classes
+Text objects that can be rotated, scaled, and translated
+A customizable 2D Camera
+A managed World system that updates, draws, and automatically offsets objects by the camera's translation.
+Collision System
+Input Handling Systems
+Particle Systems
+Pool class for efficiently reusing objects
+TileMaps
